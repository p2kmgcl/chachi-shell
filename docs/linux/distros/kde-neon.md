### KDE Neon

Although it is the default KDE experience (an Ubuntu distro with the latest
[Plasma](/docs/linux/desktop-environments/plasma.md) release) it looks a bit
unstable. The package management is a bit weird, depending on Snap as expected.
I ended up moving to [Manjaro](/docs/linux/distros/manjaro.md).
