# Fedora

Simply the best default [GNOME](/docs/linux/desktop-environments/gnome.md)

## Codecs for videos and so

1. [Enable rpm fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration)
1. [Install media codecs](https://rpmfusion.org/Howto/Multimedia)
1. Install `ffmpegthumbnailer` to have video previews in nautilus
