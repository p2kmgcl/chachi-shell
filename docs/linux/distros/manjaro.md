# Manjaro

Based on [ArchLinux](/docs/linux/distros/archlinux.md), it's the best distro
with a [KDE environment](/docs/linux/desktop-environments/plasma.md) that I have
ever tried. Quite similar to [ArchLinux](/docs/linux/distros/endeavouros.md), it
looks incredibly stable and the desktop environment configuration is very well
polished.
