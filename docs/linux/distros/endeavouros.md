This distro is based on [ArchLinux](/docs/linux/distros/archlinux.md),
preconfigured with multiple desktop environments and with extra system
management tools (similar to [Manjaro](/docs/linux/distros/manjaro.md)). After
using it for some months it looks quite stable: I chose
[GNOME](/docs/linux/desktop-environments/gnome.md), which is basically the
default GNOME no extra tweaks.
