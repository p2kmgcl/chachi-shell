# Chachi Shell

![Terminal screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p2kmgcl/chachi-shell/master/preview.png)

These are chachi dotfiles for chachi people. I have tried to automate this setup
using ansible, and also writing custom script files to manage all existing
settings, buy having some documentation that I can check over time is much more
useful for me.

The first steps I follow when installing a new system, is cleaning up unnecesary
applications, and also adding some essential ones (proper web browser, text
editor, terminal emulator, etc.):

1. Cleanup your system.
1. Choose a _nice_ wallpaper, theme and font.
1. Configure browser and terminal emulator.
1. Prepare some text editors I am using three of them right now:
   - **IntelliJ Ultimate** with built-in settings sync.
   - **Visual Studio Code** with
     [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync)
     extension.
   - **NeoVIM** with some configuration and addons stored here.
