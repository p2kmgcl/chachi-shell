# Chachi Shell

These are chachi dotfiles for chachi people. I have tried to automate this setup
using ansible, and also writing custom script files to manage all existing
settings, buy having some documentation that I can check over time is much more
useful for me.

The first steps I follow when installing a new system, is cleaning up unnecesary
applications, and also adding some essential ones (proper web browser, text
editor, terminal emulator, etc.):

1. Cleanup your system.
1. Choose a _nice_
   [wallpaper](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/category/wallpapers), theme and
   [font](/p2kmgcl/chachi-shell/blob/master/docs/fonts.md).
1. Configure browser and terminal emulator.
1. Prepare some text editors I am using three of them right now:
   - **IntelliJ Ultimate** with built-in settings sync.
   - **Visual Studio Code** with
     [Settings Sync](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync)
     extension.
   - **NeoVIM** with some configuration and addons stored here.

After that, I start configuring my
[development environment](/p2kmgcl/chachi-shell/blob/master/docs/development-environment.md)
running some extra commands. When that's ready, I should be ready to go
(although it might take a couple of hours, maybe a bit less).

Now it depends on the Linux distribution being used, I have written some
specific documentation about how I configured those environments, using lots of
distros like Ubuntu, Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Debian, CrunchBang, Manjaro,
[Archlinux](/p2kmgcl/chachi-shell/blob/master/docs/archlinux.md) and
[Fedora](/p2kmgcl/chachi-shell/blob/master/docs/fedora.md).

Finally I have some steps I follow to configure a proper environment for work
([Liferay](/p2kmgcl/chachi-shell/blob/master/docs/liferay.md)). We also have
shared documentation for all the colleagues, but these are some extra tips and
shortcuts.
